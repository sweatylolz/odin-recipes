# odin-recipes

Wow wow wow. Here is my first project using all of the knowlege I have gained so far. I am about a week or so in and starting the Project: Recipes.

It is going to showcase what I have learned so far using the command line, git and HTML. It's not gonna be pretty but it's going to be something!

Good luck.

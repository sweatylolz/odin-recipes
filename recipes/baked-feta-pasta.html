    <h4>Description</h4>
    <p>Baked feta pasta is a simple recipe made by oven roasting a 
        block of feta cheese with cherry tomatoes to create a salty 
        and cheesy sauce!</p>

    <p>You don't need to change the oven temperature. The OG recipe 
        calls for baking the feta with the tomatoes at 400Â° for 30 minutes 
        then kicking up for the last 10 minutes. After 30 minutes in the oven, 
        I found my feta well on its way to a pretty shade of golden on top. To avoid 
        burning any extra additions like garlic and herbs, I think it's best to keep 
        the temperature steady. While many recipes only call for one pint of tomatoes, 
        after testing this recipe, we decided to add two for a fuller, more flavorful sauce.
        A scoop of pasta water will help stretch your sauce to coat your pasta more smoothly and 
        generously.</p>

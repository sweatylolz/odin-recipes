    <h4>Description</h4>
    <p>Baked feta pasta is a simple recipe made by oven roasting a 
        block of feta cheese with cherry tomatoes to create a salty 
        and cheesy sauce!</p>

    <p>You don't need to change the oven temperature. The OG recipe 
        calls for baking the feta with the tomatoes at 400° for 30 minutes 
        then kicking up for the last 10 minutes. After 30 minutes in the oven, 
        I found my feta well on its way to a pretty shade of golden on top. To avoid 
        burning any extra additions like garlic and herbs, I think it's best to keep 
        the temperature steady. While many recipes only call for one pint of tomatoes, 
        after testing this recipe, we decided to add two for a fuller, more flavorful sauce.
        A scoop of pasta water will help stretch your sauce to coat your pasta more smoothly and 
        generously.</p>

    <h5>Ingredients</h5>
    <ul>
        <li>2 pt. cherry or grape tomatoes</li>
        <li>1 shallot, quartered</li>
        <li>3 cloves garlic, smashed</li>
        <li>1/2 c. extra-virgin olive oil, divided</li>
        <li>Kosher salt</li>
        <li>Pinch crushed red pepper flakes</li>
        <li>1 (8-oz.) block feta</li>
        <li>3 sprigs fresh thyme </li>
        <li>10 oz. pasta</li>
        <li>Zest of 1 lemon (optional)</li>
        <li>Fresh basil, for garnish</li>
    </ul>

    <h5>Steps</h5>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 400°. In a large ovenproof skillet or medium baking dish, combine 
            tomatoes, shallot, garlic, and all but 1 tablespoon oil. Season with salt and red 
            pepper flakes and toss to combine. </li>
        <li>Place feta into center of tomato mixture and drizzle with remaining 1 tablespoon oil. 
            Scatter thyme sprigs over tomatoes. Bake for 40 to 45 minutes, until tomatoes are 
            bursting and feta is golden on top. </li>
        <li>Meanwhile, in a large pot of boiling salted water, cook pasta until al dente according
             to package directions. Reserve ½ cup pasta water before draining.</li>
        <li>To skillet with tomatoes and feta, add cooked pasta, reserved pasta water, and lemon
             zest (if using) and stir until combined. Garnish with basil. </li>
